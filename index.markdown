Hi there, thank you for finding my page on this deep ocean. I am a Master's student at TU Munich.

I am interested in Machine Learning and computer vision specifically. Some of my blog posts will be on these topics. Feel free to check them out. 
Oh, I also like to play guitar in my free time. Check my work on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXpGVjrdOWn5YBvjzciZKbg).
